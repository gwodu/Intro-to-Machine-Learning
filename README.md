# Intro-to-Machine-Learning
This is a repository for assignments in ECE421, Intro to Machine Learning, thought by Prof. Ashish Khisti and Lucasius Christopher

## Course Description:
An Introduction to the basic theory, the fundamental algorithms, and the computational toolboxes of machine learning. The focus is on a balanced treatment of the practical and theoretical approaches, along with hands on experience with relevant software packages. Supervised learning methods covered in the course will include: the study of linear models for classification and regression, neural networks and support vector machines. Unsupervised learning methods covered in the course will include: principal component analysis, k-means clustering, and Gaussian mixture models. Theoretical topics will include: bounds on the generalization error, bias-variance tradeoffs and the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. Techniques to control overfitting, including regularization and validation, will be covered.

## Projects
The first project implements the Pocket Algorithm and Linear Regression.
The second project implements a Neural Network using forward propagation and back propagation.
The third project implements a Convolutional Neural Network using the Pytorch framework.
The fourht project implements the k-means and mixture of Gaussian models.
